<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">I'm going to say that the education in my life is just ordinary like other people.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Start when I was in primary school, in standard 6 I got 4A 1B for UPSR.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">In middle school, when I took PT3 I got 7B 1C 1D.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">In high school too, I got 5B 2C 2D in SPM. I feel like Im not smart and down at that time.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">During my diploma time I got to score CGPA 3.3 for my diplome Office Management, I feel so great that time because of this achievement, I hope that everything will go well as what we have plan, Amin.

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Based on the pictures above, they are my favorite classmates through out the high school life.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">They are my second family.  Even 4 years have passed, but we still contact each other.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Our classmates have been known the most stubborn classes out of all classes in our school because our class are the only class that consist of Malay.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">That is why when something happened that related to our class, we always have each other back.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">As you can see from the first picture, our trademark for our class is <i>"tadah tangan"</i> because our class are the only class consist of Islam and our class name is kind of islamic which is <i>"Sastera Ikhtisas Tasawwur"</i>.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">We also did a reunion every year during fasting month so we can iftar together.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Unfortunately, we cannot make a reunion this year because Covid-19 strucked in our country.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">However, we did planned that we must make a reunion next year.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Last but not least, they are the best gifts that happened through out my highschool life.

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">They are my diploma classmates and we are from A class.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">At first, it is kind of awkward because it is our first time meeting each other.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Also, we are not close to each other as every person have their own group/clan.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Fortunately, it was in our 3rd Semester where we gathered when we had our 1st simulation in Mandarin during night class.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">That is when all of the thing started, we are more closer than before.  We talked and discussed with everyone regarding the subject that we could not understand.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">That is all regarding my education life, I hope that we can meet each other during our convocation.

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">As you can see from the title and the picture above it is about experiences!
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">First one is I worked at KFC as a customer service.  By making and preparing order for guests with accuracy and efficiency.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">This is my first work that I did after SPM while waiting for SPM result.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">I had a great time working at KFC because I knew a lot of people and made friends with them.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Next job that I did is as a Banquet Server at Premiere Hotel that is located in Bukit Tinggi, Klang, Selangor.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">I did this work when I'm on my semester break as UiTM semester break are likely to be the shortest, so it is hard to find a job that need someone less than 1 month, and I decided to work as a Banquet Server.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">The duties and responsibilities of banquet server are set up for events by putting out tablecloths and place settings, arranging table placement and setting up a buffet, 
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">Carrying plates of food on trays and serving guests, perform cleaning tasks and breakdown of service and etc.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">I enjoyed doing this job because I did it with my high school friends which is my best friends.
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1.5" color="#2C3E50">I had a great time when doing this job because it is more comfortable since I did it with my friends so I do not feel bored.
